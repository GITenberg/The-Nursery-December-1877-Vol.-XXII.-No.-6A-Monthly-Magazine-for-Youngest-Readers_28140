<h2>THE STARLINGS AND THE SPARROWS.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Look</span> here, my dear," said a starling to her mate: "in
our pretty summer-villa a pair of saucy sparrows have
taken up their abode. What shall we do?"</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" cried Mr. Starling, who was calmly
standing on a fence; "why, rout them out, of course; give
them notice to quit."</p>

<p>"That we will do," replied Mrs. Starling. "Here, you
beggars, you: out of that house! You've no business
there. Be off!"</p>

<p>"What's all that?" piped Mrs. Sparrow, looking out of
her little round doorway. "Go away, you impudent tramp!
Don't come near our house."</p>

<p>"It is not your house!" said Mr. Starling, springing
nimbly to a bough, and confronting Mrs. Sparrow.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> ours!" cried Mr. Sparrow, looking down from
the roof of the house. "I have the title-deeds. Stand up
for your rights, my love!"</p>

<p>"Yes, stand up for your rights. I'll back you," said Mrs.
Sparrow's brother-in-law, taking position on a branch just
at the foot of the house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>"We'll see about that, you thieves!" cried Mrs. Starling,
in a rage, making a dash at Mrs. Sparrow's brother-in-law.</p>

<p>But two of Mrs. Sparrow's cousins came to the rescue
just then, and attacked Mrs. Starling in the rear.</p>

<p>Thereupon Mr. Starling flew at Mrs. Sparrow. Mr.
Sparrow, without more delay, went at Mr. Starling. Mrs.
Sparrow's brother-in-law paid his respects to Mrs. Starling.
There was a lively fight.</p>

<p>It ended in the defeat of the sparrows. The starlings
were too big for them.
The sparrows retreated
in good order, and left
the starlings to enjoy
their triumph.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus165.png" width="250" height="227" alt="In the tree" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Now, my dear,"
said Mr. Starling, "go
in, and put the house
in order. I'll warrant
those vulgar sparrows
have made a nice mess
in there. Sweep the
floors, dust the furniture, and get the beds made. I'll stay
here in the garden, and rest myself."</p>

<p>"Just like that husband of mine!" muttered Mrs. Starling:
"I must do all the work, while he has all the fun.
But I suppose there's no help for it."</p>

<p>So she flew up to the door of the house; but, to her
surprise, she could not get through it: the opening was not
large enough.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Starling," said she, "I do believe we have
made a mistake. This is not our house, after all."</p>

<p>"Why did you say it was, then?" said Mr. Starling, in a
huff. "Here I have got a black eye, and a lame claw, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
a sprained wing, and have lost two feathers out of my tail,
all through your blunder. You ought to be ashamed of
yourself, Mrs. Starling!"</p>

<p>"I own that I was hasty," said poor Mrs. Starling; "but
I meant well."</p>

<p>"Yes, you thought the sparrows were thieves, and so did
I. But it turns out, that we are no better than burglars
ourselves; and, what's more, we shall have a whole army of
sparrows back upon us before long. We had better take
ourselves off." And off they flew.</p>

<h2>KATIE AND WAIF.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> Katie Sinclair, and Waif is my dog. Now, as everybody
who knows him says he is the nicest dog in the world,
I will tell my "Nursery" friends why people think so.</p>

<p>First I must tell you how I got him, and how he came to
have such an odd name. One cold, rainy day, about three
years ago, I heard a strange noise under the window, and
ran to the door to see what it was. There stood a homely
little puppy, dripping wet, shivering from the cold, and
crying, oh, so mournfully!</p>

<p>I took him in, and held him before the fire till he was dry
and warm. Then I got him some nice fresh milk, which
he drank eagerly; and he looked up in my face in such a
thankful way, that he quite won my heart.</p>

<p>"Poor little dog!" said I. "He hasn't had a very nice time
in this world so far; but I will ask mamma to let him stay
and be my dog." Mamma consented; and, if that dog has
not enjoyed himself since then, it is not my fault.</p>

<p>I was bothered not a little to find a name for him. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
wanted one, you see, that would remind me always of the
way he came to me,&mdash;not a common name, such as other
little dogs have. No; I did not want a "Carlo," or a
"Rover," or a "Watch." After trying in vain to think
of a name fit for him, I asked mamma to help me.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 342px;">
<img src="images/illus167.png" width="342" height="450" alt="Kate and Waif" title="" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>She said, "Call him Waif." I was such a little goose
then (that was over three years ago, you know), that I had
to ask her what "Waif" meant.</p>

<p>"A waif," said she, "is something found, of which nobody
knows the owner. On that account 'Waif' would be a
good name for your puppy." So I gave him that name,
and he soon got to know and answer to it.</p>

<p>Waif grew fast, and we taught him ever so many tricks.
He has learned to be very useful too, as I shall show you.</p>

<p>On a shelf in the kitchen stands a small basket, with his
name, in red letters, printed upon it. To this basket he
goes every morning, and barks. When Ellen the cook
hears him, she takes the basket down, and places the handle
in his mouth. Then he goes to mamma, and waits patiently
till she is ready, when he goes down town with her, and
brings back the meat for dinner.</p>

<p>When papa gets through dinner, he always pushes back
his chair, and says, "Now, Waif:" and Waif knows what
that means; for he jumps up from where he has been lying,&mdash;and,
oh! such fun as we have with him then! He walks
on his hind-feet, speaks for meat, and catches crumbs.</p>

<p>Last summer I went out to Lafayette to visit grandma.
Mamma says, that, while I was away, Waif would go to my
room, and sniff at the bed-clothes, and go away whining and
crying bitterly. When I came back, he was nearly beside
himself with delight.</p>

<p>We never found out where he came from that rainy
day. But I don't love him a bit the less because he was a
poor, friendless puppy; and when I look into his good,
honest brown eyes, and think what a true friend he is, I
put my arms around his neck, and whisper in his ear, that
I would not change him for the handsomest dog in the
country.</p>

<h2>AMY AND ROBERT IN CHINA.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span> and Robert, with their papa and mamma, live in
China, in a place called Foochow. They came here last
January, when Amy was just three years old, and Robert
a little over one year. They came all the way from Boston
by water.</p>

<p>They have a good grandma at home, who sends Amy
"The Nursery" every month, and she is never tired of
hearing the nice stories.</p>

<p>Out here, the children see many things that you little
folks in America know nothing about. When they go to
ride, they do not go in a carriage drawn by horses, but in a
chair resting on two long poles, carried by some Chinamen
called <i>coolies</i>. When it is pleasant, and the sun is not too
hot, the chair is open; but, if it rains, there is a close cover
to fit over it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>It is so warm here, that flowers blossom in the garden all
winter; and Amy is very fond of picking them, and putting
them into vases. When it is too warm to go into the
garden, she has a pot of earth on the shady piazza, and
the cooly picks her flowers, to plant in it.</p>

<p>Foochow is on a large river; and the children like much
to go out in the sail-boats, called "house-boats." These
boats are fitted up just like a house, with a dining-room,
sleeping-room, bath-room, and pantry.</p>

<p>The night before Fourth of July, Amy and Robert started
with their papa, mamma, and Amah (their colored nurse),
and went to Sharp Peak, on the seashore, twenty-five miles
from here. They found the boat very nice to sleep in,
but were glad enough to get into their own beds the next
night.</p>

<p>I am afraid you would not know what these little children
say, if you should hear them talk; for they pick up words
from their Amah, and do not speak like little American
girls and boys.</p>

<p>By and by I shall have more to tell you about them.</p>

<h2>ABOUT TWO OLD HORSES.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> my great-great-grandfather's barn-yard stood an old-fashioned
well, with a long sweep or pole, by which the
bucket was pulled up. This well was used entirely for
the horses and cattle.</p>

<p>Grandfather had a horse named Pete, who would walk
out of his stall every morning, go to the well, take the
pole, by which the bucket was attached to the well-sweep,
between his teeth, and thus pull up the bucket until it
rested on the shelf made for it. Then old Pete would drink
the water which he had taken so much pains to get.</p>

<p>But one of my uncles had a horse even more knowing
than old Pete. This horse was named Whitey. Every
Sunday morning, when the church-bell rang, Uncle George
would lead Whitey out of his stall, harness him, drive him
to church, and tie him in a certain shed, where he would
stand quietly till church was done.</p>

<p>After a while, Whitey grew so used to this weekly performance,
that, when the bells rang, he would walk out of
his stall, and wait to be harnessed. One Sunday morning,
Old Whitey, on hearing the bells, walked out of his stall
as usual, and patiently waited for Uncle George. But it
happened that uncle was sick that morning, and none of the
family felt like going to church.</p>

<p>I do not really know what Whitey's thoughts were; but
I have no doubt that they were something like this: "Well,
well! I guess my master is not going to church this morning;
but that is no reason why I should not go. I must go
now, or I shall be late."</p>

<p>Whitey had waited so long, that he was rather late; but
he jogged steadily along to his post in the shed, and there
took his stand, as usual.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as old Mr. Lane, who sat in one of the back-pews
and always came out of church before anybody else,
appeared at the door, Whitey started for home. At the
door of the house he was greeted by several members of
the family, who had just discovered his absence, and who
learned the next day, from Mr. Lane, that old Whitey had
merely been attending strictly to his church-duties.</p>

"<span class="smcap">Good-by</span>! little Ethel, good-by!" says the Light;<br />
For what does my sleepy one need but the night?&mdash;<br />
The soft quiet night, like a great downy wing,<br />
To shelter the wee ones, too tired to sing.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Good-by till the dawning:</span><br />

"Good-by, little Ethel," so many things say,&mdash;<br />
The wind, that has played in the grasses all day,<br />
The pretty red squirrels you never can catch,<br />
And the kitten, that tries all your playthings to snatch.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When bird, bee, and blossom</span><br />

<h2>BABY'S EXPLOIT.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the first place baby had her bath. Such a time!
Mamma talked as fast and as funny as could be; and the
baby crowed and kicked as if she understood every word.</p>

<p>Presently came the clean clothes,&mdash;a nice, dainty pile,
fresh from yesterday's ironing. Baby Lila was seven
months old that very May morning; but not a sign had she
given yet of trying to creep: so the long white dresses still
went on, though mamma said every day, "I must make
some short dresses for this child. She's too old to wear
these dragging things any longer."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>When baby had been dressed and kissed, she was set
down in the middle of the clean kitchen-floor, on her
own rug, hedged in by soft white pillows. There she sat,
serene and happy, surveying her playthings with quizzical
eyes; while her mamma gathered up bath-tub, towel, and
cast-off clothes, and went up stairs to put them away.</p>

<p>Left to herself, Lila first made a careful review of her
treasures. The feather duster was certainly present. So
was the old rattle. Was the door-knob there? and the
string of spools? Yes; and so was the little red pincushion,
dear to baby's color-loving eyes.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/illus174.png" width="200" height="171" alt="Baby and feather duster" title="" />
</div>

<p>She was slowly poking over the things in her lap, when
mamma came back, bringing a pot of yeast to set by the
open fire-place, where a small fire burned leisurely on this
cool May morning. She put a little tin plate on the top of
the pot, kissed the precious baby, and then went out again.
Baby Lila was used to being
left alone, though seldom out
of mamma's hearing. At such
times she would sit among the
pillows, tossing her trinkets all
about, and crowing at her own
performances. Sometimes she
would drop over against a pillow,
and go to sleep.</p>

<p>But this morning Lila had no intention of going to sleep.
She flourished the duster, and laughed at the pincushion;
then gazed meditatively at the bright window, and reflected
gravely on the broad belt of sunshine lying across the floor.
That speculation over, she fell to hugging the cherished
duster, rocking back and forth as if it were another baby.</p>

<p>A smart little snap of the fire,&mdash;a "How-do-you-do?"
from the fire-place,&mdash;made the baby twist her little body<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
to look at it. She watched the small flames dancing in and
out, as long as her neck could bear the twist.</p>

<p>As she turned back again, her eyes fell on the pot of
yeast. Oh! wasn't that her own tin plate shining in the
sunlight? Didn't she make music on it with a spoon every
meal-time? and hadn't her little gums felt of every A,
B, C, around its edge? Didn't she want it now? And
wouldn't she have it too?</p>

<p>How she ever did it, nobody knows. How she ever got
over the pillows, and made her way across to the fire-place
in her long, hindering skirts, nobody can tell.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus175.png" width="250" height="203" alt="Baby on the floor" title="" />
</div>

<p>Mamma was busy in another room, when she heard the
little plate clatter on the kitchen-floor. Not a thought of
the real mischief-maker entered
her head. She only said to herself,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I didn't know the cat was
in there. Well, she'll find out
her mistake. I'm not going in
till I get this pie done, any
way. The baby's all right, and
that's enough."</p>

<p>As soon as mamma's hands were at liberty, she thought
she would just look in and see what kept the darling so
quiet. "All right," indeed! What a spectacle she beheld!</p>

<p>On the bricks before the fire, her pretty white skirts
much too near the ashes, sat Baby Lila, having a glorious
time. She had found her dear little plate empty; but the
brown pitcher was full enough. She had dropped the plate,
dipped the feather-duster into the yeast, and proceeded to
spread it about, on her clean clothes, on the bricks, on the
floor, everywhere.</p>

<p>So, when mamma opened the door, she saw this wee<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
daughter besmeared from head to foot, the yeast dripping
over her head and face as she held the duster aloft in both
hands.</p>

<p>Just then papa came in by another door. "O John!
do you see this child! What if she had put the duster into
the fire instead of the yeast!" Mamma shuddered as she
took little Lila into her lap for another bath and change of
clothes. Papa standing by said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You don't seem to mind having all that to do again."</p>

<p>"Indeed I don't. To think how near she was to that
fire! I can never be thankful enough that she dusted the
yeast instead of the coals. But how do you suppose she
ever got over there?"</p>

<h2>THE FOX AND THE CROW.</h2>

<span class="smcap">A crow</span>, one day, stole a nice bit of cheese,<br />
And flew up in a tree to eat it at her ease.<br />
A sly young Fox, who was passing below,<br />
Saw her as she flew, and he said, "Oh, ho!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Madam Crow."</span><br />
<br />
"What a fine bird you are, with your feathers so gay!<br />
As brilliant as the rainbow, and fairer than the day.<br />
If your voice is as sweet as your form would show,<br />
Then sing me a song: pray don't say 'No,'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">Madam Crow."</span><br />
<br />
The crow began her song, when down fell the cheese:<br />
The fox sprang and caught it as quickly as you please;<br />
And as he trotted off, he said, "Oh, ho!<br />
That is just what I wanted. I'll go,<br />

<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">The</span> woods were showing autumn tints<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of crimson and of gold;</span><br />
The sunny days were growing short,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The evenings long and cold:</span><br />
So the swallows held a parliament,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And voted it was time</span><br />
To bid farewell to northern skies,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And seek a warmer clime.</span><br />
<br />
Southward with glad and rapid flight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They flew for many a mile,</span><br />
Till in a quiet woodland glen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They stopped to rest a while:</span><br />
A streamlet rippled in the dell;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And on a hawthorn-tree</span><br />
A robin-redbreast sat alone,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And carolled merrily.</span><br />
<br />
The wandering swallows listened,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And eagerly said they,</span><br />
"O pretty bird! your notes are sweet:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Come, fly with us away.</span><br />
We're following the sunshine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For it is bright and warm:</span><br />
We're leaving winter far behind<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With all its cold and storm.</span><br />
<br />
"The iron ground will yield no food,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The berries will be few;</span><br />
Half-starved with hunger and with cold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Poor bird, what will you do?"</span><br />
"Nay, nay," said he, "when frost is hard,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all the leaves are dead,</span><br />
I know that kindly little hands<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will give me crumbs of bread."</span><br />

<h2>BIRDIE'S PIG STORY.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I told</span> my story first, as mammas usually do; and it was
all about a naughty little pig, who did not mind his mother
when she bade him stay in the sty, but crawled through a
hole in the wall.</p>

<p>Of course this pig got into the garden, and was whipped
by the farmer, and bitten by the dog, and had all sorts of
unpleasant things happen to him, till he was glad to get
back again to the sty.</p>

<p>"Now I'll tell you a pig story," said Birdie, with a very
wise look.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Once there was a big mother-pig, and she had <i>lots</i> of children-pigs.
One was spotted, and his name was Spotty; one's tail curled, and he
was Curly; another was white, and he was Whitey; another was Browny;
and another was Greeny."</p></div>

<p>"Oh, dear! the idea of a <i>green</i> pig!" said I.</p>

<p>But Birdie's eyes were fixed on the floor. He was too busy
thinking of his story to notice my remark. He went on,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"One day the pigs found a hole in the wall, and they crawled through,&mdash;all
of 'em, the mother-pig and all; and, when they got out, they ran
off, grunting with&mdash;with joy. And when the farmer saw them, he went
after them on a horse; but he couldn't catch them, for they all ran down
under a bridge where there had been a brook; but the water was all
dried up.</p>

<p>"Then the farmer got a long pole, and poked under the bridge; but
he couldn't reach them. He put some potatoes down there too, but the
pigs weren't going to be coaxed out. And when they had staid as long
as they wanted to, they came out themselves, and got home before the
farmer did."</p></div>

<p>That was the story, and I forgot to ask how they got
home before the farmer did unless he drove them; but I
think they must have gone home across the field, because
it is plain that Birdie's pigs did just as they liked all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
through. What I did ask was, "Well, what was the good
of it all?" for I thought nobody ought to tell a story without
meaning some good by it.</p>

<p>"<i>Why, they got some fresh air!</i>" cried Birdie, triumphantly;
and considering that most farmers keep their pig-sties
in a filthy condition, which can't be healthy for the
pigs, nor for those who eat them, I thought Birdie's story
had a very good moral, which is only another way of saying
that it had a good lesson in it.</p>

<h2>OUR FRIEND THE ROBIN.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> very hard winter, a robin came, day after day, to
our window-sill. He was fed with crumbs, and soon became
tame enough not to fly away when we opened the window.
One cold day we found the little thing hopping about the
kitchen. He had flown in at the window, and did not
attempt to fly out again when we came near.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>We did not like to drive him out in the bitter cold: so
we put him in a cage, in which he soon made himself quite
at home. Sometimes we would let him out in the room,
and he would perch on our finger, and eat from our hand
without the least sign of fear.</p>

<p>When the spring came on, we opened the cage-door and
let him go. At first he was not at all inclined to leave us;
but after a while he flew off, and we thought we should
never see him again.</p>

<p>All through the summer and autumn, the cage stood on a
table in a corner of the kitchen. We often thought of the
little robin, and were rather sorry that the cage was empty.</p>

<p>When the winter set in, we fancied we saw our old friend
again hopping about outside the window. We were by no
means sure that it was the same robin; but, just to see
what he would do, we opened the window, and set the cage
in its old place.</p>

<p>Then we all left the room for a few minutes. When we
returned, we found, to our great delight, that the bird was
in the cage. He seemed to know us as we petted him and
chirruped to him; and we felt certain that it was our dear
old friend.</p>

<h2>SAGACITY OF A HORSE.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A Young</span> gentleman bought a hunting-mare from a
farmer at Malton in England, and took her with him to
Whitby, a distance of nearly sixty miles. One Wednesday
morning the mare was missing from the field where her
owner had placed her. A search was made for her, but
with no success.</p>

<p>The next day the search was renewed. The owner and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
his groom went some ten miles, and were told that the mare
had crossed the railway the morning before. At this point
the trail was easy. The mare had taken the high road to
her old home at Malton.</p>

<p>Six men had tried, but in vain, to stop her. At a place
called Pickering, she jumped a load of wood and the railway
gates, and then, finding herself in her old hunting country,
made a bee-line for home. In doing this, she had to swim
two rivers, and cross a railway.</p>

<p>She was found at her old home, rather lame, and with one
shoe off, but otherwise no worse for her gallop of nearly
sixty miles across the country,&mdash;all done in one day; for
her old owner found her on Wednesday night, standing at
the gate of the field where she had grazed for two previous
years. Was she not a pretty clever horse?</p>

<h2>PHANTOM.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have a little white dog whose name is Phantom.
This is his portrait. I hope you are glad to meet him.
Ask him to shake hands. He would do so at once if you
could only see him in reality.</p>

<p>When he was only a few months old, he followed us all
to church without our knowing it; nor did we see him, till,
in the most solemn part of the service, we heard a patter,
patter, patter, coming up the aisle, and there stood Phantom
at the door of our pew. In his mouth was a long-handled
feather duster, which he had found in some obscure corner
of the building, and where it had been put (as it was supposed)
carefully out of everybody's way.</p>

<p>Phantom is very intelligent, and has learned a number of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
tricks. He can understand what is said to him better than
any dog I ever knew; but he is best known among the
children here for his love of music and singing.</p>

<p>He has only learned one song yet; but he knows that as
soon as he hears it. Wherever he may be,&mdash;up stairs, or
down stairs, or out of doors,&mdash;if he hears that song, he will
sit up, throw his head back, and you will hear his voice
taking part in the music.</p>

<img src="images/illus187.png" width="500" height="374" alt="Playing for Phantom" title="" />
</div>

<p>You may sing a dozen songs, all in about the same tone;
but he will take no notice till he hears the tune he has
learned, and then he will sing with you&mdash;not in a bark or
a yelp, but in a pure, clear voice, as if he enjoyed it.</p>

<p>If you could see him sitting up, with his nose in the air,
his mouth open, and his fore-paws moving as if playing the
piano, and could hear his music, I am sure you would laugh
till the tears came into your eyes.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
